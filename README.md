# Real-Time Mask Detector

- Tensorflow, OpenCV2, numpy, pydot, and matplotlib are required
to run all codes properly.

- `detect.py` is a video demo from the camera. Press key `q` to exit
the video demo.

- All Jupyter Notebook should be run under `src` working directory.

- logs can be shown as graphs in Tensorboard. run `python3 -m tensorboard.main --logdir=logs/fit/<logname>` under `src` working directory to start a tensorboard server. Access URL `localhost:6006` to see the Tensorboard dashboard.

- There are terribly a lot of files in this repository, so I recommend
to download zip instead of cloning the whole repository.

Enjoy!
